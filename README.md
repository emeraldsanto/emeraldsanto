### Greetings ðŸ‘‹

I'm Yanick, a 22 year old mobile developer from Montreal, Canada. I specialize in cross-platform development using React Native and Flutter, but that doesn't mean native development scares me. Oh, and I absolutely love TypeScript.

### What I'm currently doing

I work for a fintech [startup](https://www.moka.ai) building full-stack cross-platform mobile applications. The tech stack I'm using daily consists of React Native, TypeScript and NodeJS. On top of that I also do freelancing work for an awesome [startup](https://nightborn.be) based in Brussels, Belgium.

### Have a project for me?

If you or your company is looking for an experienced React Native developer, or somebody who can do it all, please contact me using the links below.
